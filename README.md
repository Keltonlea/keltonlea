# Hello World, I'm Kelton! 👋 Nice to virtually meet you! 🙂

I am Web Developer in Bellingham, WA with a Bachelor’s Degree in Social Sciences and a minor in business administration. I am a naturally curious person which makes me want to always learn new things, a problem-solver, and a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously and enjoys the little things.
